Artagon is a community driven project developed by seven graphic artists and developers. Our team spans the globe and is made up of people from all walks of life. Some of us were born in the depths of poverty while others grew up in a life of luxury.

Our aim is to become the most productive asset on Solana by rewarding each holder of the maximum 3,500 NFTs. (from now on we will refer to the 3,500 NFTs as the 3500 Artagon OGs)

Through Artagon X we reach creators and collectors outside of the NFT scene which will enable us to reach audiences previously not involved and/or interested in NFTs.
